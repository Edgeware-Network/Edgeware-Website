role: Edgeware Builders Group

The role is multi-faceted in that is community focused but also development focused. The Edgeware Builders Group is a loose organisation of technical contributors to Edgeware, from a smart contract and runtime perspective.

The organisation is in need of more individuals who can help manage activity within by:

- Identifying applications that should be built to help developers onboard to Edgeware.
- Building applications that are fun and novel for the Edgeware ecosystem, as examples or fully-fledged projects.
- Managing other junior developers to help find them projects and mentor them throughout their growth as Edgeware Builders.
- Leading new initiatives and helping shape the narrative around the Builders. When we get excited about new projects, we want to keep the momentum and make sure we plan to grow in the right direction.

## Leadership

This role will be fluid and require leadership skills. There are many proposals and ideas floating in the builders community but a lack of clarity around who will formalise these proposals into work and start these projects. Some of these areas and projects are

### Pallet ideas

- ORML NFT pallet for dApp developers
- Acala EVM Accounts linking pallet for Substrate <> EVM account interoperability

### Smart contracts

- Chain extensions for pallets so Ink! developers can access pallet functionality
- New EVM precompiles
- Games and experiments such as Flappytips and more.

### Developer tooling

- [https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-matrix-faucet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-matrix-faucet)
- Supporting the existing builders tooling such as the Beresheet faucet and Yieldscan deployments.

### Construction Projects

- Reviewing active bounties and encouraging new developers to build out these pallets
- Engaging the community in Edgeware Proposals Element group.
- Creating proposals for funding.

## Funding

With the right execution, this individual will be positioned to get funding from the Edgeware Treasury to help manage the Edgeware Builders Guild. This will make onboarding new developers easy and provide funding to build out applications in the areas above.

There will be funding provided by Commonwealth Labs towards this pursuit initially, with the intention to move to Treasury funding as the role develops and stability is reached.
